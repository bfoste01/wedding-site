Julie and I are getting married in 16 months! We figured since we both have so much time on our hands we should create a site with info about our wedding including: planning, preparation and aftermath. Actually, the first part of that is not true at all. Julie is always busy working at Sample6 Technologies in Boston, and Brandon is busy pursuing his Ph.D. in the Eliot-Pearson Department of Child Development at Tufts University.Julie is always more busy than Brandon, but Brandon is better at looking busy. Anyways, the truth is we're both a little crazy to be working on this website (thus the name *Two Crazy Kids*). 

## Why even bother with all of this?

Everyone is really good at documenting the actual wedding, but the process often gets lost. We want to have a memory of it all! As such, this site will document all those little decisions that couples make along the road leading to that big day. 

### *Okay, okay, let's be transparent about what led up to this website*:

Julie wanted to blog about the wedding, Brandon wanted to dabble in web development. We put our heads together to find a happy medium... Brandon built the website, Julie manages the content and all ends happily ever after. 


To that last point, we encourage anyone and everyone to interact with us here. Brandon buildt a comments section into the website, so at the bottom of every blog post you will find a place to enter your comments. Please, do not just keep the comments to general platitudes. Those of you who have done this before and have good ideas should feel compelled to share those ideas, as should just about everyone else who has a good idea to share with us.
