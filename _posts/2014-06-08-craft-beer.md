#American Craft Beer Festival 2014
Last weekend Boston welcomed [The American Craft Beer Festival](http://www.beeradvocate.com/acbf/) . Julie and I attended the Saturday afternoon session, which is always the most crowded. The whole occasion was a blast! Around one-hundred and fifty different breweries brought almost 650 different beers to the session. The whole experience has me thinking about the beers we will serve at our wedding.

**Forgive me in advance while I indulge in sharing some quick observations of beerfest:**

- First,  Northeast breweries are still showing up in large numbers for this event, with a combined 84 different breweries coming out of Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Vermont. This fits with trends in the past. 
- Second, this is still largely an event for hop-heads, with American IPAs, Double IPAs and Pale Ales dominating the styles. 
- Third, Saisons continue to creep into the popular palate. My favorite saison, [Jack D'or](http://prettybeer.com/wp/our-beers/jack-dor/) from Pretty Things Brewery based out of Westport, MA, was the best in show. 
-  Fourth, the elusive [Lawson's Finest Liquids](http://www.lawsonsfinest.com) made an appearance. Now for those of you that don't do the craft beer thing, this is a REALLY BIG f*ck@ng deal! Julie and I spent a weekend in Vermont trying to find some of that goodness to no avail, but that's another story. Nevertheless, we were very happy to finally taste Lawson's [Maple Imperial Stout](http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/lawsons-finest-fayston-maple-imperial-stout/92733/), and it was damn close to a perfect thing! 
-  Fifth, the pretentious hipster trends within the craft beer movement still continue to be a really bad thing. Case and point: the trend this year of including himalayan salt or sea salt in beers to "open up the palate."  The salt did not open the palate, and instead crowded out any complexity the beer exhibited.
-  Sixth, it seemed like every other brewery was including the hop variety called [Falconer's Flight](http://hopunion.com/falconers-flight/) as a solitary hop addition into their IPAs and Pale Ales. It's a pretty gnarly tasting and smelling hop, but also seemed like bit of a quixotic move. This is because I am most familiar with that hop as a bittering addition that you then layer other hops onto in your brews, so to see it so forward in the beers was a surprise.

**Our Beerfest Highlights:**

Brandon: [Bengali Tiger](http://sixpoint.com/beers/core/bengali) IPA from Sixpoint brewery in New York. It's like no other IPA I've ever tasted. It's what I described as, "the perfect popcorn beer!" It had a buttery mouthfeel like no IPA I've ever had, with a bit of a butter-like taste too, which I assume came from the grain bill. The hops gave me a passion-fruit vibe, which makes me think Citra hops played prominently. It was not the best IPA I've ever had, but it was really different and for that I give the beer a lot of respect.

Julie: [Schilling Beer Co.](http://www.schillingbeer.com) out of Littleton, NH. Their thing is old-world European styles (i.e.,Belgian, Czech, Polish and German traditions). Specifically, their Pater, which is a Abbey-style Singel, was Julie's favorite. She sees a trip to Littleton in our future.


## Bringing it Back to the Wedding
The question of what to brew for the wedding has been on my mind a lot lately. From the moment we started talking about planning the wedding I have had the desire to brew something for it, as it seems like a nice way to add a bit of personality to the typical wedding affairs. It's really been a matter of *what to brew* and *how much to brew*? I still do not have an answer for the latter, but the former is becoming a bit more clear. 

The most important thing I took away from beerfest was that the kinds of beers I typically like to drink probably will not be the best choice for our wedding. Why? I like hoppy beers... the kind of beers where the hops rip the enamel of your teeth. If you're going to do it, you might as well go all the way with it, right? Obviously, not a good choice for a wedding. To that point, I question my ability to exercise a bit of restraint with the hoppy brews. I know I can keep the IBUs (i.e., bitterness) down in my hoppy brews, but it's not a style where I'm ready to exercise subtlety. I just don't think I've matured to that point of refinement in my brews, and I'm not sure I care to with IPAs and Pale Ales. Therefore, I'm thinking outside of hop-monsters. 

Anyways, my evolving thoughts on a beer menu is as follows (and as always subject to change):

- [Blonde Ale](http://beersmith.com/blog/2013/03/21/blonde-ale-recipes-and-beer-style/), which is a light beer with moderate carbonation and more malt forward, so the grains will be the thing to play with in this style. 
- Potentially a nice brown ale.
- Or a brew where the grain rye is prominent, as rye reminds me of autumn and would be a fitting brew grain for the occasion.
- I would really love to brew either a pale ale or a massive Double IPA for those who enjoy hops, but have yet to figure out how or if I want to integrate these beers into the menu. Obviously, there's a huge difference between a pale ale and a Double IPA, but I could see a Double IPA being the high-octane specialty beer on the menu. 

All of this will come together more as I brew over the next 6 months to try some new styles out. I'll keep you posted!
