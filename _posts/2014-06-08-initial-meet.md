#Two Crazy Kids, One Crazy Story (Part 1)
By now it feels like Brandon an I have always known each other. Really, I feel like I have always known that he is an uncontrollable fiend for sugar and will eat any and all sweets in the house (unless they contain peanut butter **HA!**) and he has always known that, left un-checked, I will just keep buying cheese at the grocery store as if I'm anticipating some sort of cheese-shortage crisis (*seriously*).

Hard to believe then, that we actually met only a few years ago under what I still consider to be somewhat dubious circumstances...

###*Flashback to Halloween 2010*

I am dressed, as I have been for every Halloween party since college, as a butterfly/fairy/girl wearing wings and a purple dress (because, laziness). It is roughly 1 week before Margrett and Jon's wedding and I am at a party with Margrett which is being thrown by another of her bridesmaids, Erin. Margrett is also dressed as a butterfly/fairy/girl wearing wings and colorful pajamas (because, Margrett). 

I do not know many people at this party so I make the standard halloween costume-centered small talk (nice jason mask/sexy cowgirl/sexy construction worker/whatever that is supposed to be? costume, etc.). 

One of these such comments I toss out is a "Nice Clark Kent costume!" toward a tall thin man wearing a red button-down shirt open enough to reveal a superman shirt underneath and thick, black rimmed hipster glasses. I believe his response was "Uh, thanks" which he accompanied with the quick turning away of his head that I took to mean "I am not interested in talking to you" so I also turned away to talk to someone else while thinking that really, some people just have *NO* manners.

###*Fast-forward to New Year's Eve 2010*

Two months have gone by, Margrett and Jon are married (!) and we are back at Erin's for a dressy New Year's bash with my awesome brother, Sam and his lovely girlfriend, Emma, in tow. I am wearing a new dress and Margrett is wearing not-pajamas, we are well stocked with champagne and determined to have a good time! 

^*Except, confession time, I was not excited to go to this party. I usually spend New Year's at home in my pajamas and, despite being initially excited by the change in routine, I am now faced with a situation in which I must **wear tights** and **talk to people**. I have spent the last 20 minutes before leaving for the party sitting in Margrett's bathroom while Emma attempts, in vain, to curl my stubborn not-curly-but-not-straight hair and have decided that this is not really what I want to be doing. But! Margrett and Emma have rallied me into at least outwardly displaying the above mentioned "Yay, champagne!" attitude and off we go.*

So we are at this party and having a pretty good time, this time I know most of the people here and Emma keeps refilling my champagne glass when I'm not looking so all-in-all it's a pretty good time! 

And then, while I'm sitting in the kitchen talking to people and minding my own buisness, Margrett comes rushing up to me exclaiming "What are you doing?!". She proceeds to sit in front of me and says "I just found out that the cute tall guy with the beard sitting in the living room IS SINGLE! **WHY ARE YOU NOT TALKING TO HIM?!**" I mumble something about "hanging out" and "having a perfectly nice time" but she is not deterred. "Just go talk to him! He seems nice!"

It is at this point that Emma walks up to us and says "Julie! That cute guy sitting on the couch is single! You should get him to kiss you at midnight!"

By now, dear readers, mayhaps you've guessed that the above-mentioned gentleman is the one-and-only Brandon Foster? And maybe you've also guessed the he is the same gentleman whom I complimented on his Clark Kent costume? Bingo! Allow me to fill you in on what his sister, Kayla was saying to him while they sat on that couch. "That cute girl in the white dress is single! Go talk to her, you loser!"

Can you see what's happening? Do you now understand why I consider these circumstances dubious? Yes, we were the only two single people at this party. And as soon as the three lovely ladies who now make up my bridal party got wind of this fact they spent *the rest of the evening* trying to get us to talk to one another. 

So we played beer-pong against my brother and Emma and lost (I can only carry a team so far...) and we watched Ryan Seacrest frigidly smile in front of a lot of screaming people and we talked about what we did and what we were interested in and at midnight I looked at him and said "Well I guess you should kiss me." So he did. And then he was embarassed (a little cute) and said "Well maybe now we should get to know each other a little better." So we talked some more and exchanged numbers and then the party was over so he left and I went back to Margrett's and woke up with the Worst. Hangover. Ever. (because, champagne) and didn't really think anything of it. And then, a few days later, he called me.

Some time later this happened.

But, that's another story...
