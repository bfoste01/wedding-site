So you decided join us at our wedding. First, we are really thankful that you will be there to join us on our important day. We have an amazing group of family and friends. We promise to throw one hell of a party for y'all. 

>You're going to need a place to stay after eating and drinking, shaking your booty and partaking in other general wedding-related festivities.  

On this page we will compile hotels and B&Bs in areas most proximal to where we are getting married.

**Coming Soon**
