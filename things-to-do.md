We are getting married on Labor Day weekend. You've reached this part of the site because you are thinking of making it a long weekend. In fact, if you can swing it, we encourage you to hang out in the Upper Valley all weekend! The mountains of New Hampshire & Vermont are a wonderous place in September! 

We built this part of the website with you in mind. We want to help you make a plan for some cool things to do while you are in the area. 

>We want to help you find:

- Fun Recreational Activies
- Fun Sites to Explore
- Fun Places to Eat
- Fun Places to Drink
- Fun Places to Shop

You get the point...

The rest is **Coming Soon...**
